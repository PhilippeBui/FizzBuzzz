# FizzBuzzz
The Fizzbuzz problem is very simple. It is used to show understanding of loops, conditional statements, print function and uses the modulus operator.

Prompt:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
